    <h3>Jorin Stamatiou</h3>
    <h4>Student number: s3872832</h4>
    <p>I’m a 23-year-old Tax Preparer born and raised in Perth. I work full time in an accounting firm and have
      been for the past 5 years. My interest in IT was fostered at a very young age, I recall dad teaching me the
      basics of computing around the age of nine and it snowballed from there. I recall building programs in visual
      basics as well as being the IT monitor in middle school due to my adept knowledge for my age.</p>
    <h3>Lachlan Cresswell</h3>
    <h4>Student number: s3378980</h4>
    <p>I’m a 26-year-old audio technician based in Melbourne. Being a full-time employee for Australia’s largest
      concert audio provider, I’ve worked on stages such as Falls Festival, Download Festival and Splendour in the
      Grass as well as arena tours with the likes of Hilltop Hoods and Bring Me the Horizon. I grew an interest
      in IT as a kid while playing video games and discovering the internet on the family computer and later learning
      to program homebrew for the Sony PSP handheld. Hobbies I have picked up over the years include playing music
      and 3D printing. The recent closure of the music industry has led me to pursue further education in IT as a
      second career path. With existing skills in the JavaScript and Python programming languages, as well as
      network architecture from working with audio networking systems, I hope to develop further knowledge of
      server-side technologies and web application deployment.</p>
    <h3>Zorren Miller</h3>
    <h4>Student number: s3874332</h4>
    <p>I'm 31, Live in Falls Creek Victoria. Chef by trade, only cook in winter season unless special occasion
      or the local pizza oven we have every Friday in summer unless we decide to go somewhere else. For the last
      few summers, I have been working as a laborer and shuttling the mountain bike riders up to the summit in
      Falls Creek also the company does at mt Buller, Beachworth, Bright and mt Beauty. Last year I started layer
      1 fiber optics in the village, where we put fiber into the building not just to the node like Telstra. I
      like to keep busy, so I have few things on the cards, for fun I take my motorbike out and about the valleys
      or exploring with my Ute. I first got introduced into html and graphics when I was 11 at the local library.
      I played around for a while but got into other things. While the world is ever getting more technology based,
      plus the pandemic that has struck the world, I thought it was a great time to get back started into IT as I
      have a bit more time as I have started my own business last year.</p>

    <h3>Michelle Woolley</h3>
    <h4>Student number: s3858026</h4>
    <p>I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in Tasmania, Australia. I relocated to Sydney in 2018 before moving
      to Melbourne in 2019 to be closer to family. I am from an Australian background, with many generations of my family
      having been born and raised in Australia. I completed a Bachelor of Nursing in 2013 at the University of Tasmania
      and worked as a nurse until June of this year. I love to read, cook, game, craft, and travel. I have very limited
      IT experience; however, my interest was sparked when I began online courses to teach myself HTML and CSS earlier
      this year which encouraged me to pursue further education and new job opportunities.</p>
