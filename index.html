      <p class="info">I’m a 23-year-old Tax Preparer born and raised in Perth. I work full time in an accounting firm
        and have been for the past 5 years. My interest in IT was fostered at a very young age, I recall my dad teaching
        me the basics of computing around the age of nine and it snowballed from there. I remember building programs in
        visual basics as well as being the IT monitor in middle school due to my adept knowledge for my age. My hobbies include
        weightlifting, gaming and Squash.</p>
      <p class="info">The abrupt changes the world has taken in the past few months have encouraged me to return to studies
        to invest my time and knowledge into an industry that is both increasing in relevance as well as is very flexible in the sense
        that it can be either in house of fully abroad with little to no change in operation. </p>

      <p class="info">I’m a 26-year-old audio technician based in Melbourne. Being a full-time employee for Australia’s largest
        concert audio provider, I’ve worked on stages such as Falls Festival, Download Festival and Splendour in the
        Grass as well as arena tours with the likes of Hilltop Hoods and Bring Me the Horizon.
      <p class="info">I grew an interest in IT as a kid while playing video games and discovering the internet on the family computer and later learning
        to program homebrew for the Sony PSP handheld. Hobbies I have picked up over the years include playing music
        and 3D printing. </p>
      <p class="info">The recent closure of the music industry has led me to pursue further education in IT as a
        second career path. With existing skills in the JavaScript and Python programming languages, as well as
        network architecture from working with audio networking systems, I hope to develop further knowledge of
        server-side technologies and web application deployment.</p>

      <p class="info">I'm 31, Live in Falls Creek Victoria. Chef by trade, only cook in winter season unless special occasion
        or the local pizza oven we have every Friday in summer unless we decide to go somewhere else. For the last
        few summers, I have been working as a laborer and shuttling the mountain bike riders up to the summit in
        Falls Creek also the company does at mt Buller, Beachworth, Bright and mt Beauty. Last year I started layer
        1 fiber optics in the village, where we put fiber into the building not just to the node like Telstra.</p>
      <p class="info"> I
        like to keep busy, so I have few things on the cards, for fun I take my motorbike out and about the valleys
        or exploring with my Ute.</p>
      <p class="info"> I first got introduced into html and graphics when I was 11 at the local library.
        I played around for a while but got into other things. While the world is ever getting more technology based,
        plus the pandemic that has struck the world, I thought it was a great time to get back started into IT as I
        have a bit more time as I have started my own business last year.</p>

      <p class="info">23, live in Emerald, Vic. I currently work in gardening and landscaping, but that is not my intended career path
        in the future. I do this work to make money, but my interests primarily lie in building and maintaining online
        communities, and video game design.</p>
      <p class="info"> I have six years of experience in leading and moderating online communities
        for developers/publishers Double Fine Productions, Warner Bros Games and IO Interactive. I am most deeply involved
        currently with IO Interactive, working with them regularly to foster a growing fanbase for the Hitman game series.</p>
      <p class="info">
        A further fledgling interest I have is in QA, but I am in the process of learning more about it and have not had much
        experience in the industry yet. Most of my experience in QA is informal, where I have pushed games to their systematic
        limit and tried to break them for fun. I have done some casual testing for the game Full Throttle Remastered, and
        have been involved in testing for other smaller games as well.</p>

      <p class="info">I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in Tasmania, Australia. I relocated to Sydney in 2018 before moving
        to Melbourne in 2019 to be closer to family. I am from an Australian background, with many generations of my family
        having been born and raised in Australia. I completed a Bachelor of Nursing in 2013 at the University of Tasmania
        and worked as a nurse until June of this year.</p>
      <p class="info"> I love to read, cook, game, craft, and travel.
        My favourite place I have travelled to so far is Hawaii, I loved learning about the history and culture.</p>
      <p class="info"> I have very limited
        IT experience; however, my interest was sparked when I began online courses to teach myself HTML and CSS earlier
        this year which encouraged me to pursue further education and new job opportunities.</p>
