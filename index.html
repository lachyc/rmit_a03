      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3872832</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I’m a 23-year-old Tax Preparer born and raised in Perth. I work full time in an accounting firm
        and have been for the past 5 years. My interest in IT was fostered at a very young age, I recall my dad teaching
        me the basics of computing around the age of nine and it snowballed from there. I remember building programs in
        visual basics as well as being the IT monitor in middle school due to my adept knowledge for my age. My hobbies include
        weightlifting, gaming and Squash.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">The abrupt changes the world has taken in the past few months have encouraged me to return to studies
        to invest my time and knowledge into an industry that is both increasing in relevance as well as is very flexible in the sense
        that it can be either in house of fully abroad with little to no change in operation. </p>

      <h3 class="name">Lachlan Cresswell</h3>
      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3378980</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I’m a 26-year-old audio technician based in Melbourne. Being a full-time employee for Australia’s largest
        concert audio provider, I’ve worked on stages such as Falls Festival, Download Festival and Splendour in the
        Grass as well as arena tours with the likes of Hilltop Hoods and Bring Me the Horizon.
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I grew an interest in IT as a kid while playing video games and discovering the internet on the family computer and later learning
        to program homebrew for the Sony PSP handheld. Hobbies I have picked up over the years include playing music
        and 3D printing. </p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">The recent closure of the music industry has led me to pursue further education in IT as a
        second career path. With existing skills in the JavaScript and Python programming languages, as well as
        network architecture from working with audio networking systems, I hope to develop further knowledge of
        server-side technologies and web application deployment.</p>

      <h3 class="name">Zorren Miller</h3>
      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3874332</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I'm 31, Live in Falls Creek Victoria. Chef by trade, only cook in winter season unless special occasion
        or the local pizza oven we have every Friday in summer unless we decide to go somewhere else. For the last
        few summers, I have been working as a laborer and shuttling the mountain bike riders up to the summit in
        Falls Creek also the company does at mt Buller, Beachworth, Bright and mt Beauty. Last year I started layer
        1 fiber optics in the village, where we put fiber into the building not just to the node like Telstra.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo"> I like to keep busy, so I have few things on the cards, for fun I take my motorbike out and about the valleys
        or exploring with my Ute.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo"> I first got introduced into html and graphics when I was 11 at the local library.
        I played around for a while but got into other things. While the world is ever getting more technology based,
        plus the pandemic that has struck the world, I thought it was a great time to get back started into IT as I
        have a bit more time as I have started my own business last year.</p>

      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3871390</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I’m 21 years old, born in the Southern Highlands, south of Sydney. I am currently working as a Signals Officer
        in the Australian Army, having been in for around 4 years.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">My interest in IT began when I was young, like many others it was fostered through video games. I took several
        IT related subjects in school, gaining a wide array of knowledge in the field of IT, however not specialising in any field. My current
        role has developed knowledge of communication mediums, primarily through radio frequency means, with a focus on telecommunications
        installations and equipment.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">My hobbies include gaming, weight training and AFL.</p>

      <h3 class="name">Timothy Bridges</h3>
      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3650170</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">23, live in Emerald, Vic. I currently work in gardening and landscaping, but that is not my intended career path
        in the future. I do this work to make money, but my interests primarily lie in building and maintaining online
        communities, and video game design.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo"> I have six years of experience in leading and moderating online communities
        for developers/publishers Double Fine Productions, Warner Bros Games and IO Interactive. I am most deeply involved
        currently with IO Interactive, working with them regularly to foster a growing fanbase for the Hitman game series.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">
        A further fledgling interest I have is in QA, but I am in the process of learning more about it and have not had much
        experience in the industry yet. Most of my experience in QA is informal, where I have pushed games to their systematic
        limit and tried to break them for fun. I have done some casual testing for the game Full Throttle Remastered, and
        have been involved in testing for other smaller games as well.</p>

      <h4 class="studentNum">Student number: s3858026</h4>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo">I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in Tasmania, Australia. I relocated to Sydney in 2018 before moving
        to Melbourne in 2019 to be closer to family. I am from an Australian background, with many generations of my family
        having been born and raised in Australia. I completed a Bachelor of Nursing in 2013 at the University of Tasmania
        and worked as a nurse until June of this year.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo"> I love to read, cook, game, craft, and travel.
        My favourite place I have travelled to so far is Hawaii, I loved learning about the history and culture.</p>
      <p class="indexBoxInfo"> I have very limited
        IT experience; however, my interest was sparked when I began online courses to teach myself HTML and CSS earlier
        this year which encouraged me to pursue further education and new job opportunities.</p>

    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings" id="namePadding">Completed by Luke</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">After having reviewed the test outcomes for each person in Group 21, it is obvious that everyone has come from different backgrounds
      with different experiences, ultimately showing the diversity that groups can have. This component will be laid out to display the results for each person,
      including the Myers-Briggs Test, the Big Five Test or equivalent, and the Learning Style Test.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The individual results from the group on the Myers-Briggs Test (MBT) were all quite unique, with <u>not a single result being replicated within the group.</u>
      Timothy was described as a ‘Mediator’, Michelle was described as a ‘Defender (ISFJ-T)’, Lachlan was described as a ‘Logician (INTP)’, Luke was described as an ‘Advocate (INFJ-T)’,
      Jorin was described as a ‘Protagonist (ENFJ-A)‘ and Zorren being described as a ‘Virtuoso (ISTP-A/ISTP-T)‘.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Big Five Test</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">As with the MBT, the Big Five Test also carried a unique set of results for each person. Michelle scored high levels of openness to experience, conscientiousness
      and agreeableness. Lachlan scored high levels in agreeableness and intellect/imagination. Timothy did not conduct a Big Five Test but did conduct a creativity test which he scored
      very high on. Luke scored high levels on openness to experience and agreeableness. Jorin also conducted a similar personality test, of which he scored high on as a Pragmatist.
      Zorren scored high levels in being achievement driven.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Learning Style Test</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Michelle’s primary learning style is Reflector, Timothy’s primary learning style is a Tactile/Kinaesthetic, Lachlan’s primary learning style is Auditory,
      Luke’s primary learning style is Visual, Jorin’s primary learning style is split evenly as Reflector and Activist, with Zorren’s primary learning style being visual,
      physical and logical learning.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">How this information will be helpful to the group</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">This information will ensure that all group members are aware of each other's potential strengths and weaknesses when it comes to the assimilation and
      production of information; how they interact with other group members or team members in other environments; and how they potentially interact with others on a day to day basis.
      This can lead to a basic understanding of what tasks can be given to group members to ensure motivation and enjoyment is maintained whilst still achieving satisfactory completion
      of tasks. Further development as a group will allow for cohesive workflows to occur and allow for allocation of tasks and information to eventually become autonomous as a team
      becomes more effective.</p>
