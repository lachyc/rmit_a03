    <p class="techReportInfo">Luke’s ideal job is as an ASD Strategic and International Policy Officer. Key skills required in this role are excellent team-work skills,
      ability to adapt to a changing environment, complex problem-solving skills, knowledge of a broad range of IT concepts, and the will and ability to learn

    <p class="techReportInfo">Timothy’s ideal job is as a QA Specialist. A person in this role is responsible for overseeing the ongoing quality of a video game
      as it is in production; communicating with each specialised team in the wider development team to ensure they are working towards a cohesive vision.
      Required skills for this position include prior experience in a QA role, knowledge of Perforce, knowledge of build-management tools, documentation skills,
      an eye for detail, proactive personality, great written and verbal communication skills and an eagerness to develop skills further as the role requires.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Michelle’s ideal job is as a Frontend Developer. This role requires someone well-versed in web development with the ability to work
      and communicate effectively with UI/UX designers; and with knowledge of both the design and technical sides of web dev. Excellent attention to detail is
      required for this position; as is good communication skills. Being able to work well in a team is essential, including in a leadership role is also important.
      Further technical skills include experience in front-end development; Javascript, React, HTML5, CSS3 and Git.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The differences in the above job roles are immense and truly highlight how diverse the IT industry is. There are thousands of distinct
      IT roles available globally, each requiring unique skill sets that may be specially developed over many years; however, in the above sample data set some
      consistently required skills already leap out. Being ready and willing to learn new skills that the job requires is a common theme, which makes sense as most IT
      professionals specialise in a distinct area and as that area changes and develops a specialist needs to be able to learn and adapt with the cutting edge. Another
      common element among the above jobs is that excellent written and verbal communication is required. Gone are the days of the cliché ‘basement dwelling IT nerds’,
      these days IT professionals are the glue that holds the modern world together and are often part of large teams that require clear threads of communication to function
      smoothly and efficiently. This segues finely into the final major common thread between the job descriptions which is the ability to work in a team. IT work in the
      21st century is increasingly complex and specialised; therefore, companies require a team of specialists to work together towards a goal. If an IT professional cannot
      function well in a team-based environment, they may hold the whole company back from achieving its goals. For this reason, it makes sense that so many IT job descriptions
      call for a solid ability to work in a team.</p>
