    <p class="techReportInfo">On the 15th of October 2020, our team interviewed Blake Dean who is a Business Analyst with Gratex International. Gratex has offices in both Europe and Australia;
      with the branch Blake works for being based in Sydney. Blakeâ€™s role as a Business Analyst is to liaise with clients to help manage their business and create software that suits their needs.
      Blake has a background in networking and software engineering; which aids in his effectiveness to understand and communicate with his clients and developers.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Blake currently has two pet insurance clients, with one being in New Zealand and the other in Australia. As all clients are different, he deals with people that have knowledge of
      software development to people that just have ideas for the company; this varies depending on the client or project.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Blake spends most of his time in meetings with his clients and developers to translate or troubleshoot the software to ensure they create the best suited product for the client's needs.
      With every project there are challenges and as a Business Analyst Blake must liaise with the client and developer to make sure that any changes or upgrades do not conflict with anything else with the
      software which could cause further issues.</p>
