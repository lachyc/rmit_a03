      <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">By Timothy</h3>
      <p class="techReportInfo">Natural language processing (NLP) is the science of teaching computers to understand and parse natural language.
        Natural language is a language that has developed in society as a natural product of our need to communicate, as opposed to a machine language,
        which we develop to command computers and write programs.</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">Natural language processing has been in development in various forms since the 1950s. Alan Turing’s paper at the time,
       titled ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’, discussed an experiment where an interrogator tried to guess which of two subjects is a computer
       based upon their responses to questions. He posits the question of whether a computer could ‘think’ well enough to fool the interrogator into believing
       it was human. This test is one of the earliest thought experiments that considered natural language processing and generation as potential areas of interest.</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">In the 60s, one of the most notable and famous examples of a NLP program was developed, known as ELIZA.
        ELIZA was designed to emulate the responses of a psychotherapist; interestingly, the creators designed it as a parody of the impersonal nature
        of a psychotherapy session. This shows some level of self-awareness on the part of the creators of how primitive the technology was at the time,
        as the program was only able to respond by matching basic patterns in the responses it received.</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">Jumping forward to modern times, we have invested a large amount of resources into developing NLP. Many of us always have
        a machine capable of more advanced NLP in our pocket which we may engage with in a more casual manner than ever before. One example of a modern
        integration of NLP technology is automated chat bots for customer service. These chat bots endeavour to cut out the need for human interaction
        in every instance of customer service. For example, a student at a university might type into the online help chat box ‘I am lost on the university
        campus!’ The bot will hopefully then be able to identify based on key words such as ‘I, lost, campus’ that you are lost on campus and direct you to
        a map on the university website.</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">Another commonplace example these days is personal assistants such as Apple’s Siri or Google Assistant. Programs such as
        these can understand and respond to not just text but spoken language. Speech recognition technologies rely on comparing the waveforms of your
        voice input to a waveform database to look for the closest match. The computer then checks what word is associated with that waveform match to
        form a sentence to respond to. The more people use speech recognition software, the more the companies learn about different voices, which improves
        speech recognition software and in turn attracts more users. This creates a feedback loop in which the technology can continue to advance and flourish;
        a dream scenario for any software developer.</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">NLP and speech recognition technologies will continue to infiltrate more areas of our lives. Many of the most dominant tech
        companies in the world employ NLP in their products, and actively encourage users to engage with them. Windows 10 has the Cortana assistant which
        allows you to interact with your computer by speaking or typing commands. Microsoft really pushes Cortana as a core feature when you first set up
        Windows, indicating their interest in the space. Other companies like Amazon sell cheap machines like Amazon Echo, which are designed as a virtual
        home assistant device which you interact with exclusively with your voice. These devices have quickly become very popular, especially in the US market
        due to Amazon’s ubiquity. As a result, their software exponentially improves as more new users pick one up every day. Smart home devices will likely
        push people further into ‘consumer bubbles’ where they make most of their everyday purchases through only one company, as we can see with Amazon Echo,
        where you can just ask it to make a purchase and it automatically completes the purchase for you. The convenience of this poses other issues such as what
        happens if you are drunk and make a large non-refundable purchase? What happens if someone else speaks to the device and makes a purchase on your account?
        These issues are just two among many.</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">Further advances in NLP technologies are likely going to begin costing jobs. Relatively primitive speech recognition software
        already exists on support lines for example, where the bot on the end of the line asks you to speak your command or question like you would to a
        human. Unfortunately, most people would agree that it does not feel natural yet and find themselves having to speak awkwardly slowly or clearly for the
        bot to understand what you are asking. This technology may have already cost jobs as many companies, especially larger ones, will often leap upon any
        opportunity to automate a task, regardless of whether the tech is highly advanced or not yet.</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">I do not engage with NLP much in my life, for example I personally do not see myself purchasing any type of smart home device.
        In my opinion, it is a far too invasive technology and there are issues of privacy when a corporation has a device that is always listening sitting in
        my living room. I dislike how little public education there is on the topic of tech privacy; something which I’m interested in spreading the word on and
        have already started to do so amongst my friends and family. For example, due to my interest in IT, some family members have asked if I would like to
        receive a smart home device for my birthday or for Christmas as they see it as a new and interesting technology. I always use these moments as an
        opportunity to explain and educate about the potential privacy issues around having such devices in the home, and most people so far have been receptive
        and interested to learn more about privacy. NLP technologies are not going away. They are only going to get better and more advanced as time goes by; but,
        I think we need to regulate how it will be used, where it will be used if we want to retain jobs like customer service roles, and to maintain or in some
        cases reclaim basic privacy in our home, away from the corporate eye.</p>

      <h2 class="containerSubHeadings">single board computers</h2>
      <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">By Lachlan</h3>
      <p class="techReportInfo">During the last two decades, there has been a rise in a range of computers known as Small Board Computers (SBCs),
        a category home to well-known brands such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Makey Makey. Featuring a broad range of potential
        applications and use cases, the SBC category includes a wide array of hardware arrangements with products available from many
        different suppliers. Typically, each board contains either a microcontroller or microprocessor at its core, with a range of
        memory and I/O options attached. This offers a barebones, low cost, and easily expandable hardware platform from which a
        range of different hardware or software solutions can be developed, tested and deployed.</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">Platforms such as Arduino, Teensy and Wemos offer ranges of SBCs based around microcontrollers. These basic circuits
        lack the operating system or video output features typically provided by a computer, instead offering low power systems
        with low level I/O options. This allows the device to communicate with sensors, actuators, motors and other electrical
        circuits, providing computerised control and communication to otherwise basic systems. These microcontroller-based boards
        have seen wide use in smart home applications where the hardware allows lights, power relays and various sensors to be connected
        to a network and controlled remotely. The simple hardware and basic software offering packaged in a small form factor allow
        these ‘smart’ devices to remain small in size and small in required power.</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">Outside of the microcontroller offerings, the world of SBCs containing microprocessors reaches far and wide. One of
        the most popular platforms is the Raspberry Pi. Being built around a microprocessor and containing RAM, USB, and video
        output support almost as standard; the Raspberry Pi and its competitors more closely resemble a typical PC. Software
        support compared to the microcontroller offerings is far deeper, with Linux and Android based operating systems available
        and even Microsoft Windows 10 depending on the board chosen.</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">Created in the UK in 2012, the Raspberry Pi went on to sell over 12.5 million units in its first five years and has become
        one of the most well-known SBC systems available (Barnes 2017). While all available models allow for a wide range of development
        possibilities, the platform was initially developed with the aim to further enable computer science teaching in schools (Moorhead 2012).
        The ability to load a desktop operating system and connect a keyboard and mouse while being available at a low price has even allowed
        the Raspberry Pi to be adopted in developing countries as personal computing devices as well as in education (Churcher 2017).</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">While the Arduino, Raspberry Pi and many other systems began as methods of developing simple ideas and enabling electrical integration or
        allowing easier access to computers, the market has matured over the last decade and is beginning to see great advances at the forefront.
        As the demand for ‘smart’ devices and other internet connected units increases, the requirement for ‘edge computing’ has grown along with it.
        This is the notion of shifting data processing from remote servers to be closer in proximity to the user, at the entry point or ‘edge’ of
        the network (IBM Cloud Education 2020). This premise relies on many computing devices at the edge, embedded in speakers, hubs, TVs and
        the like, providing different types of network input and output methods; exactly the job SBCs are fit for. Seen recently in products such
        as the Nvidia Jetson and the Google Coral systems, GPUs are becoming an important hardware addition in these miniature computers due to their
        ability in processing AI and machine learning data. For the end-user, this means less latency next time they ask Alexa to play a song and
        enables a higher standard of privacy, as data no longer needs to be transferred to a remote server for processing. For the provider,
        it allows for a higher efficiency option as the amount of data required to traverse the network is lowered; a factor which has become
        more important as internet infrastructure development struggles to maintain pace with technological development (Grijpink et al. 2018).</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">With further expansion of services such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa providing AI and other complex data-driven feature-sets,
        demand for edge computing solutions and, in turn SBC platforms, are due to increase. Not only will processors and hardware be improved but
        clusters of SBC systems, connected both locally and over smaller networks, are likely to see utilisation; allowing many boards to work in tandem.
        These advancements and demands will require not only specific hardware and network knowledge from technicians and engineers but also knowledge
        on containerisation softwares such as Docker and Kubernetes. These programs offer methods of bundling and distributing instances of a given
        software in a robust and efficient manner, executable on different platforms or hardware (IBM Cloud Education 2020). In the five years between
        September 2014 and September 2019, demand for Docker as a skill rose by over 4000% on the job search site indeed.com, a skill which did not
        even exist in 2013 (Flowers 2019).</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">With proliferation of platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes, it would seem as important as ever for those working in network infrastructure,
        DevOps and IT administration to be aware of upcoming trends and advancements to maintain employability and their skillsets. AI and other data
        driven services which previously required large data-centres are undergoing migration to edge computing solutions. With some analysts predicting
        that 75% of enterprise-level data will be processed outside of centralised data centres, up from 10% in 2018, SBC systems are likely to help
        foster this movement; lowering the hardware barrier for new technologies from state-of-the-art server farms to affordable, Raspberry Pi-like
        infrastructure (van der Meulen 2018).</p>
      <p class="techReportInfo">Looking at these recent advancements in modularisation and shrinkage of computer infrastructure from the point of a consumer, the advancements
        in SBCs won’t be obvious but their increased application will be. Smart devices are becoming more prevalent in the home with devices such as TVs,
        doorbells and even the ordinary vacuum seeing considerable feature-set upgrades in recent years. Brand new products are also seeing adoption with
        hubs and smart speakers bringing AI and machine learning into the household, each becoming ‘smarter’ as edge computing grows in prominence.
        For someone interested in IT and it’s applications, the increasing amount of use cases for small computing devices such as the Raspberry Pi and
        Arduino means an increased demand in knowledge and experience with these platforms and their associated software environments. Tools that were once
        used to prototype basic ideas and saw applications in the hobbyist space are undergoing rapid adoption in large IT markets, all-the-while maintaining
        their affordability. This means that, while the skillset of an IT worker is increasing every day, the ease of access to the hardware and software of
        SBCs allows simple and direct pathways to gain experience in these growing areas.</p>
