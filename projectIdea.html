    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Completed by Lachlan & Michelle</h3>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Overview</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">This project involves building a web-based service that provides education and advice to cat owners regarding items which are toxic to cats. The service
      will allow users to access information on various foods, plants, household products and medications and have them identified before being provided with
      evidence-based information on whether they are dangerous to cats and what they should do if their cat has come into contact with a toxin. In the event a user
      believes their pet has been poisoned, the app will provide them with the capacity to find pet poison hotline numbers and veterinary clinics near them.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Motivations</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">It can be difficult for cat owners to find toxin information for cats. A quick google search reveals there is a variety of information available for
      dog owners in relation to poisoning, however, the same is not available for cat owners; particularly in relation to mobile apps. Due to cats being fussy eaters they are less
      likely to be poisoned than dogs (International Cat Care 2020). This could be a contributing factor as to why there are limited resources available for cat owners. Yet, as a
      result of their curiosity and the fact cats could groom toxic substances off their coats, poisoning in cats is not an uncommon occurrence (International Cat Care 2020).
      Factors which can lead to cats becoming ill after toxin exposure include their small size, ability to mask exposure, and their inability to break down certain chemicals
      (International Cat Care 2020). As a result of these factors, cats can be less likely to recover from poisoning than dogs (International Cat Care 2020). According to DeClementi (2014),
      one of the best ways to prevent pet poisoning is to provide pet owners with basic poison prevention information. Due to the aforementioned reasons, a mobile app would be an essential
      tool for cat owners to enable them to quickly find toxin information in the event of a time-critical poisoning.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Similar apps available on the Google Play store include ‘Plants for Cats’ created by Delattre Consulting (2020) and Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) created
      by American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)(2014). APCC is quite detailed in the information it provides to users, covering plants, medications, foods,
      and household hazards; however, it is an American based app and the emergency poisons hotline numbers are for American residents only. In comparison, ‘Plants for Cats’ provides
      contact details for emergency poisons hotlines for multiple countries; however, its content is limited to plants only. The aim of this proposed project is to bridge the gap
      between these apps and offer a service that provides all of these features within the one product.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Description</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The main feature of the service will be the ability to search for and gain information on items that may be toxic to cats. When opened, the app
      will display four selections the user will be able to choose from: search and identify toxins, search and identify symptoms, find a veterinary clinic nearby, and
      poison hotline numbers. When the user selects the search toxins option a list of the categories the user can search through will be displayed: food, medications,
      plants, household products, and a view all option. The user will have the ability to either browse through the list or use a search bar to search for a specific item
      they want information about. In the instance of plants, users will be able to upload a photo to have the plant identified. When a specific item is either selected or
      identified, the user will be displayed the following information: a picture of the item; a description of the item; why it is toxic to cats; symptoms the cat will
      display if the toxin has been ingested; and treatment Information.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">When the user selects the option to find a nearby veterinary clinic, their location will be determined automatically if location services have been
      enabled; otherwise, they will be shown an input field to be able to enter their postcode. Once this is submitted, the user will be displayed with a list of the veterinary
      clinics within that suburb ordered from closest to farthest away. The details of each veterinary clinic will include the name of the clinic, clinic address, phone number,
      email address (if available), opening hours, and whether they accept emergency or after-hours patients. The name of the veterinary clinic will be a link that when clicked on
      will redirect the user to the website for the clinic. There will be an option for the user to filter by a preferred veterinary clinic if they wish e.g., only display Greencross
      Vet clinics, or to filter by available hours e.g., only show open clinics or clinics available after-hours.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">When the user selects the option for poison hotline numbers, they will be displayed with a list of available hotline services they can contact for
      further information and advice. The information displayed will include the name of the service, phone number, email address, and operational hours e.g., whether they are
      a twenty-four hours service or have specific operating hours. The name of the service will be a link, similarly to the name of the veterinary clinic, that when clicked
      will redirect the user to the website for the poison hotline.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">An addition to this app which is being considered is the ability for the user to search and report toxins identified within their local area via
      either a map or postcode search. This would be a particularly useful tool for owners of outdoor cats that may roam out of sight of the owner and ingest an unknown substance.
      This addition would give the owner capacity to look for toxins within their area and identify what may have been consumed by their cat. If a user identifies a toxin within
      an area, there will be an option to submit the postcode, suburb or specific location coordinates and details of the toxin.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Tools & Technologies</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The backbone of the service will be provided via the Node.js server platform. This will allow the small development team to be maintained with
      developers being able to share frontend and backend work via the shared JavaScript environment (Clever Solution 2020).</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Information delivered through the website will be stored in and retrieved from a MySQL database. MySQL is a relational database, providing a good
      fit for the structured nature of the data stored in this project, and is a mature and well-supported platform, allowing quick deployment and a wide variety of documentation
      to aid setup and maintenance (Harkushko 2020).</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">User interface implementation will be provided by HTML, CSS, JavaScript and accompanying HTML5 standards. Both location services and image uploading
      will be provided via standard browser methods. All interface content will be served from the default Node.js HTML service.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">To achieve plant identification and searching, the plant.id service machine learning API will be used. Access to the service is provided on a per-request
      basis and trial access is available for the testing and prototyping development phases. Examples are available in the provided platform documentation which includes JavaScript
      samples, the method to be utilised for this project.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Alongside the creation of the website interface and server back end, a mobile application will be developed in tandem. Primary service features will
      be provided by an integrated web view, displaying the website, with further, platform specific features and enhancements enabled via additional menus and buttons.
      The Android application will be developed with only the standard development systems and software required. Accompanying Android hardware will be required during the
      application testing period.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Skills required</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">A range of skills and team members will be required to implement the services tools and technologies outlined earlier; however, in spending time
      choosing the correct tools, some requirements are shared across several areas of the project.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Implementation of the server, database, and Plant.id API will require knowledge in JavaScript for development within the Node.js runtime; a core
      understanding of SQL as well as MySQL database interfaces; and experience integrating an external API. Knowledge in these areas will be provided by Lachlan who has
      experience in both JavaScript development and SQL database integration. Time will be initially allocated in researching API integration to ensure feasibility of this feature-set.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">User Interface development will require a knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as accompanying knowledge of design principles. Michelle, an aspiring
      frontend developer and the project lead, will handle the site design and creation.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Creation of the app will require some research into Android app development but, due to primary functions being provided by an embedded browser view, time
      will only be spent implementing and creating the accompanying, mobile-specific features. Knowledge of the Java programming languages will be required and a proof of concept
      prototype will be created via online, freely available boilerplate samples (Free Code Camp, Inc. 2018). With access to Android device emulators for PC, access to and know how to
      operate an Android device to be able to build and test the functionality and usability of the app will only be required on reaching the testing phase.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Research, data entry and database management skills will also be utilised. After initial installation of the database and its accompanying tools, data collection
      and entry will be managed by accompanying team members. Both Michelle and Lachlan will oversee data management and collection, providing relevant information and support where required.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Outcome</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">As previously mentioned, education is one of the best ways pet poisoning incidents can be reduced and prevented. If this project was successful, pet owners would
      have an educational resource readily available to them to help them keep their cats safe. While cat poisonings will undoubtedly still occur, the risk would be significantly reduced and the
      possibility of death occurring would be considerably minimised due to the inclusion of veterinary and hotline contact details.</p>
