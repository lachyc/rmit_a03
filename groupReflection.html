    <p class="techReportInfo">So far the team based assignment has gone fairly well. Although the start was a bit sluggish. We did manage to pull out efforts together and become quite an effective team
      towards the end however. And I am happy to report that we have all pulled our weight so to speak and in the end came out with an assignment I think we’re all proud of.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Improvements that could have been made were us possibly getting our communication down packed at an earlier stage of the assignment so that we could feel less rushed however this was
      minor because it didn't really affect our progress so to speak.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Looking back I have learnt that you can get support from your group at times you think it might be inconvenient, it may seem like a burden at first to have a group fill of 6
      people however it becomes quite the opposite the more you develop as a team.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Interestingly enough our personality tests would lead us to believe that we would not be an effective group, however from my experience in the past few weeks this wasn't in fact correct.
      Funnily enough, despite our communication not being at optimal levels towards the beginning I think that we got very effective towards the end and there was no clashing of heads and we gelled quite well
      resulting in a strong assignment.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Lachlan</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The proceedings for the team-based assignment 2 have gone well. Despite a slow start the team has come together to quickly organise and reach each required goal.
      I can confidently say that we have all done well and provided support and quality work to the assignment in unique ways.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">An improvement would be to have the team come together earlier or, at very least, have some more conversation about the assignment topics and sections ahead of time.
      Though, I think this would still be difficult to achieve, even if we were to repeat the process again. Bringing together a team of six people who have never met each other and without a
      common administration body, as found in a regular organisational environment, would always be difficult and slow to start.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">One thing I have learned about groups is that teammates can help fill the gaps and support areas which you may personally be concerned or cautious about. For example,
      report writing and the like is not a strong skill of mine but knowing others in the group enjoy or are confident in this area is both unexpected and motivating.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Along the way a surprising thing I noticed was that every member had a different resulting ‘personality’ in the MBTI test. It is interesting to see that, despite
      sharing a common interest in IT and working well together on this assignment, we are all different people.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Zorren</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">As a team we have put together a task required by RMIT, which has given us an insight on what is to come for us during this course.
      Also, this gives us insight for further assignments on which areas where people excel and where they need assistance. For a team this is a good introduction as
      communication through the group for this first assessment has been adequate, but improvement is just the natural course whilst working in groups so we can all
      communicate properly with each other.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">With anything there are improvements that need to be addressed, that is the way of life. As this is the first group assignment there
      will be many areas that will need to be improved on; but, as the team moves to get to know each other dilemmas will be on the decrease.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Life is a surprise, but the surprise should not be taken as a negative or a positive it should give insight on something that may have been missed.
      In saying this, as a group there are areas that do need to be worked on which can only be done in time, as we as the group have implemented the procedure that has been given by RMIT,
      we all have had contributions. As this team continually works though this course the progression of ideas will flow through the team.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Luke</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The general conduct of the group in allocating tasks, self-imposing timelines and ensuring openness and fidelity in content has been done well. This has ensured that
      all members of the group have remained up to date on where certain components of the task has been to completion and allowed for accountability if deadlines weren’t met.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">An improvement identified would be taking early advantage of the allocation of tasks as a group. The group was slow to start the discussion and reporting, however easily
      found a rhythm to all work off that suited all members and their own personal requirements. The slow start has not been a massive imposition on the group work itself and will only improve as the
      group continues to work into the future.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">A surprising factor of the group was the diversity of our backgrounds, with a vast array of age groups, employment environments, personal interests and previous experiences.
      This directly influenced my learning about groups, showing that it can be quite smooth to throw random people into a group and make them work together, as long as there is a common goal/interest and
      the group is given enough time to acclimatise to the environment in which they work in.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Timothy</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">I am happy with the outcome of the assignment. I personally worked on a report on Autonomous Vehicles, which I found difficult to write but extremely interesting; a report on
      Natural Language Processing, which was also tricky; and the Ideal Jobs section. The first two reports presented a challenge in researching the varying opinions on the future of the technology,
      taking longer than I expected to get a rounded view; yet, the Ideal Jobs section was not too difficult. I think that our meetings went very well and we don’t have any disastrous disagreements in
      the group, which helps things run smoothly.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Next time, and I’m sure everyone else in the group will write the same, we need to mobilise a lot earlier. For this assignment we left it multiple weeks before we even began
      really talking, which led to a bit of a mad rush by the end of it. Things worked out though.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">I was surprised by how different we all are in our personalities and backgrounds, and glad that we all worked well together regardless. This showed me that a common goal in
      a group can be achieved no matter who is part of the group, so long as you all have the same vision and a drive to see it through.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Michelle</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Overall, I feel the majority of our team members collaborated well together. Each member of the team showed enthusiasm to help out.
      Everyone worked well towards completing their allocated sections in time for submission.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Something recognised by all of us is that we should have commenced working on the assignment earlier than we did. We have managed to get all content completed in time;
      however, we would not have had as much pressure on ourselves if we had started earlier. We have already made plans to rectify this issue before the commencement of assignment 3.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">It was surprising to me what a wide variety of backgrounds we had amongst our team members. Timothy works in gardening and landscaping, Luke is a Signals Officer,
      Zorren is a chef, Lachlan is an audio technician, Jorin is a tax preparer, and I am a nurse. It seems like such an unlikely mix of people to come together to complete an IT assignment together.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">As reflected in our personality quiz results, there was very little overlap within individual results; yet, we have all collaborated on this assignment reasonably well
      together. As a result of this, I have learned that huge differences between team member personalities does not mean those members will not be able to work effectively together.</p>
    <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Group</h3>
    <p class="techReportInfo">As a group, the consensus appears to be that we collaborated well as a team. While we all acknowledge we should have started working on the assignment much sooner than
      what we did; we have managed to come together and efficiently complete the assignment together to a standard we are all confident with and proud of.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Allocation of sections was done based on each member's interests and skill sets. Luke completed the team profile and cybersecurity reports. Timothy completed the ideal
      jobs section, as well as reports on autonomous vehicles and natural language processing. Michelle completed the tools section, created the group web page, and collaborated on the project idea
      report. Jorin completed the industry data section and proofread the report document. Zorren completed the IT work section. Lachlan completed a report on single board computers, as well as
      collaborated on the project report. Lachlan also led our team meetings and completed meeting minutes and agendas.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Things we as a team recognise we need to do better are communicating earlier and starting the assignment earlier. Due to the extension of the submission date, we were
      comfortably able to complete all the assignment elements on time; however, we would have struggled to meet the original submission date due to our late start. We do acknowledge though that
      as we were six people who did not know each other prior to starting this assignment, it would be difficult to start working on an assignment together without first having a group rapport
      built up. As we have gotten to know each other much better over the last few weeks, it is unlikely we will experience similar issues moving forward with assignment 3.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Something which has surprised us all is that six people with such different personalities from a very broad range of backgrounds have been able to come together and
      work successfully as a team. We think this was largely helped by the fact we all share the common interest of IT.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">We have learned that one of the major benefits of working in a team is having the support of other people. Where one of us may have a weakness in one area, another member
      has been able to provide assistance by sharing their strength in that area. This has been a great benefit to us all as we have been able to learn from, teach, and support one another; leading
      to increased confidence amongst team members.</p>
