  <p class="techReportInfo">As a team we have put together a task required by RMIT, which has given us an insight on what is to come for us during this course.
    Also, this gives us insight for further assignments on which areas where people excel and where they need assistance. For a team this is a good introduction as
    communication through the group for this first assessment has been adequate, but improvement is just the natural course whilst working in groups so we can all
    communicate properly with each other.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">With anything there are improvements that need to be addressed, that is the way of life. As this is the first group assignment there
    will be many areas that will need to be improved on; but, as the team moves to get to know each other dilemmas will be on the decrease.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">Life is a surprise, but the surprise should not be taken as a negative or a positive it should give insight on something that may have been missed.
    In saying this, as a group there are areas that do need to be worked on which can only be done in time, as we as the group have implemented the procedure that has been given by RMIT,
    we all have had contributions. As this team continually works though this course the progression of ideas will flow through the team.</p>
