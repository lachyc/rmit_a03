  <p class="techReportInfo">So far the team based assignment has gone fairly well. Although the start was a bit sluggish. We did manage to pull out efforts together and become quite an effective team
    towards the end however. And I am happy to report that we have all pulled our weight so to speak and in the end came out with an assignment I think we’re all proud of.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">Improvements that could have been made were us possibly getting our communication down packed at an earlier stage of the assignment so that we could feel less rushed however this was
    minor because it didn't really affect our progress so to speak.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">Looking back I have learnt that you can get support from your group at times you think it might be inconvenient, it may seem like a burden at first to have a group fill of 6
    people however it becomes quite the opposite the more you develop as a team.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">Interestingly enough our personality tests would lead us to believe that we would not be an effective group, however from my experience in the past few weeks this wasn't in fact correct.
    Funnily enough, despite our communication not being at optimal levels towards the beginning I think that we got very effective towards the end and there was no clashing of heads and we gelled quite well
    resulting in a strong assignment.</p>

  <p class="techReportInfo">The proceedings for the team-based assignment 2 have gone well. Despite a slow start the team has come together to quickly organise and reach each required goal.
    I can confidently say that we have all done well and provided support and quality work to the assignment in unique ways.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">An improvement would be to have the team come together earlier or, at very least, have some more conversation about the assignment topics and sections ahead of time.
    Though, I think this would still be difficult to achieve, even if we were to repeat the process again. Bringing together a team of six people who have never met each other and without a
    common administration body, as found in a regular organisational environment, would always be difficult and slow to start.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">One thing I have learned about groups is that teammates can help fill the gaps and support areas which you may personally be concerned or cautious about. For example,
    report writing and the like is not a strong skill of mine but knowing others in the group enjoy or are confident in this area is both unexpected and motivating.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">Along the way a surprising thing I noticed was that every member had a different resulting ‘personality’ in the MBTI test. It is interesting to see that, despite
    sharing a common interest in IT and working well together on this assignment, we are all different people.</p>
  <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Zorren</h3>
  <p class="techReportInfo">As a team we have put together a task required by RMIT, which has given us an insight on what is to come for us during this course.
    Also, this gives us insight for further assignments on which areas where people excel and where they need assistance. For a team this is a good introduction as
    communication through the group for this first assessment has been adequate, but improvement is just the natural course whilst working in groups so we can all
    communicate properly with each other.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">With anything there are improvements that need to be addressed, that is the way of life. As this is the first group assignment there
    will be many areas that will need to be improved on; but, as the team moves to get to know each other dilemmas will be on the decrease.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">Life is a surprise, but the surprise should not be taken as a negative or a positive it should give insight on something that may have been missed.
    In saying this, as a group there are areas that do need to be worked on which can only be done in time, as we as the group have implemented the procedure that has been given by RMIT,
    we all have had contributions. As this team continually works though this course the progression of ideas will flow through the team.</p>

  <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Timothy</h3>
  <h3 class="techNameSubHeadings">Michelle</h3>
  <p class="techReportInfo">Overall, I feel the majority of our team members collaborated well together. Each member of the team showed enthusiasm to help out.
    Everyone worked well towards completing their allocated sections in time for submission.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">Something recognised by all of us is that we should have commenced working on the assignment earlier than we did. We have managed to get all content completed in time;
    however, we would not have had as much pressure on ourselves if we had started earlier. We have already made plans to rectify this issue before the commencement of assignment 3.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">It was surprising to me what a wide variety of backgrounds we had amongst our team members. Timothy works in gardening and landscaping, Luke is a Signals Officer,
    Zorren is a chef, Lachlan is an audio technician, Jorin is a tax preparer, and I am a nurse. It seems like such an unlikely mix of people to come together to complete an IT assignment together.</p>
  <p class="techReportInfo">As reflected in our personality quiz results, there was very little overlap within individual results; yet, we have all collaborated on this assignment reasonably well
    together. As a result of this, I have learned that huge differences between team member personalities does not mean those members will not be able to work effectively together.</p>
