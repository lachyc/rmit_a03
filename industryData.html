    <p class="techReportInfo">Both Zorren and Lachlan endeavour to pursue their aspirations within the Software Engineering field, specialising in differing expertise. The official
      job title is referred to as ‘Software Engineer’. This ever-growing sector is seeing a steady rate of demand as corporations and employers have shifted their focus toward growing
      their online presence. It’s a sign of the times where the necessity of Software Engineers has far outweighed the supply. As a rank, the demand is equal first for this job title.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Luke’s ideal employment contrasts as compared to other group members where their ideal jobs are scouted by employers predominantly in the private sector,
      whereas, Luke’s employer is the government sector. The official job title is Strategic and International Policy officer; however, this job typically is reserved for government or
      government backed entities such as the Australian Signals Directorate. The demand for this role is secure and in growth, given the individual is capable and proficient.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">The vacancy for the aforementioned position remains constant as the Australian Government perceives this role as highly desirable. This is respective to
      the government signals industry for both domestic and international defence programs. In this day and age, the demand for this qualification is only increasing. As a rank demand
      is second for this job title.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Michelle’s interests are directed more towards web development and specially Frontend development. The job title itself is Frontend Web Developer, being
      such a relevant thing, one would think that the web development industry is saturated; however, this is not in fact accurate if you can prove you pertain desirable knowledge
      and passion for the industry, employees demand radical minds that can both pioneer the industry as well as think outside the box and for that reason Frontend web developers
      are still in great demand. As a rank, demand is equal third for this job title.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Timothy’s preferred job follows suit with Michelle’s in regards to competitiveness. The official job title is Quality Assurance Specialist and Timothy
      hopes to find employment in the gaming sector. Provided that he can display a high level of tenacity and employee confidence, the role is in high demand from employers
      looking to ever better their reputation and standards in this competitive industry. All-in-all this is a job qualification in high demand. As a rank, demand is equal third
      for this job title.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Jorin’s ambition is to work in the same sector as Timothy, the official job title is Senior Developer and like Timothy, also specifically in the game
      industry. Employers from large gaming corporations are always expanding their workforce and rather than micromanaging creative teams they are steering towards employing more
      and more Senior Developers to lead projects on a more intimate level boosting productivity and the sense of creative freedom. This role is highly desirable in the industry
      right now and all signs point towards an even bigger demand for Senior Developers in the future. As a rank, the demand is equal first for this job title.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">When it comes to general skills required by the group, they all follow suit quite closely. All job titles require productive communication,
      onfidence and tenacity, comprehensive problem-solving skills as well as good people skills. Writing is another one; however, writing in a sense where they have to be
      proficient in drafting paragraphs and summaries of situations or design propositions more so than writing formal letters to individuals. However, for something such as
      Senior Developer or Strategic and International Policy Officer both are in fact necessary.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">IT specific skills vary widely; however, the skillset would include an array of languages such as C++, Python, Java and HTML for web design and development
      as well as non-language skills such as proficiency in signals analysis, Unity graphics design proficiency and encryption and decryption proficiency for Senior Development and
      Strategic and International Policies Officers.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Employers can either look for very specific skills that are only relevant to that exact job title or they could be interested in skills that are used broadly
      across all fields of IT. It is hard to accurately say which is more important than the other. In saying this, the online world has become more complex and therefore more dangerous
      than ever; data theft, data heists and exploitation of information has never been more prevalent. This puts Proficiency in Data Encryption and Decryption at the top of the hierarchy,
      from actions as simple as password protecting certain files to extensive MD5 hash and brute force resistant protective procedures; it seems nothing is more important these days than
      protecting data. This would be ranked highest when it comes to demand from employers.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Closely following this would be language skills (coding languages) as these are relevant in almost all sectors of IT. Java, C++, Python and HTML are all used
      frequently for many different reasons, the fact that these languages can be used to both build something as simple as a single page website but as extensive as a communications platform
      for a multiplayer game goes to show that they are highly desirable and therefore in high demand from employers. These would all be ranked equal second in demand.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Both Signals Analysis and Unity graphics design proficiency are in the same boat so to speak. They are both very desirable as Signals Analysis is mandatory for
      the profession and Unity proficiency is the gold standard for graphics design however they are only relevant in their specific field. Outside of their field they are not the most imperative
      skills in a general IT environment. This is why they’re ranked equal third in demand from employers.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">When it comes to the general Skills, there is less ambiguity in the ranking for demand by employers. Without a doubt communication skill is in highest demand,
      without these skills’ productivity would be minimal and ineffective. Communication Skills are in very high demand and a critical employment point for potential employers. Communication
      Skills are therefore ranked first and foremost.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Problem Solving Skills follow in the tracks of Communication Skills, Problem Solving Skills are required of not just team leaders but all employees in order to
      achieve team cohesion within the workplace. Problem Solving Skills comes in at a close second in demand from employers.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Finally Writing skills, writing skills are important in not just any sector of IT but any sector in business as a whole. In IT however relevant departments
      play their role in the team environment, an individual that has the skills to perform IT specific skills with great success and also pertains the required communication skills to
      communicate to relevant team members can get away with having a lower writing skill level as they can communicate their information effectively to another individual that may be
      much more proficient in actually composing a piece of writing but have less skill in the field being written on. Where one individual may excel in a certain field the other may in
      another, in this case writing fits this agenda. This is unlike Communication Skills and Problem-Solving skills where it is imperative that all parties are very proficient in both of these
      skills. This is why Writing Skills comes in at third in terms of demand from employers.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Business Management, Business Analysis and Technical support are the three highest ranked IT-Specific skills not required in our skill set. This is understandable
      seeing as none of our ideal jobs directly utilise these skills, both Business Management and Business Analysis are more corporate department roles that do not directly apply to specialist
      roles such as the ones we are discussing. Additionally, Technical Support may apply to website design however not to the job Frontend Web Design that focuses on building and establishing
      the website rather than maintaining said website. These are all understandably not directly required in our skillset.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">When it comes to general skills that are not required, Troubleshooting, Research and Creativity are the three highest ranked. Again, this is understandable seeing
      as our Ideal Jobs require specialty skills for a specialty job, the job description is not ambiguous. Troubleshooting is for bug hunters or Alpha/Beta Testers, R&D is for someone specifically
      in the R&D department of these corporations and Creativity is a precursor to most of these roles; an example being that the creative design would already be done prior to a Frontend Web
      Designer beginning their coding or a Senior Developer would oversee the development of a creative project; however, it is not their requirement to micromanage and get involved in the
      creative aspects of a project as they must treat all sections of the project with an equal amount of attention.</p>
    <p class="techReportInfo">Having looked at the Burning Glass data and discussing our findings with the group none of our opinions on our ideal jobs has changed. This is likely due to the
      fact that the data is relatively favourable to our views. The occupations we are passionate about pursuing have been depicted in a favourable light. If anything, the opinion of our
      ideal jobs has been reinforced. The demand for these jobs is seen to be high according to the data provided and if we extrapolate this data, one would assume that these jobs will only
      increase in employer demand and take a more pivotal role in the industry. Roles shown in the data such as Solutions Architect, Graphic Designer and Systems Engineer are all in great demand
      and these are the generic titles for the niche professions we intend to specialise in. This leads to high employee value in the workforce in an ever-strengthening industry. The Burning Glass
      data both reinforces the information above as well as reinforces our opinion on our ideal jobs.</p>
